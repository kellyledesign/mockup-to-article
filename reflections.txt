You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

It wasn’t too difficult (yet!) since I am already familiar with basic syntax, but I’ve learned new tags such as “figures”, “sup”, and “hr”. I also got to practice more well-formatted coding.

I had trouble with the website accepting my code for the button, and I’m not really sure what went wrong there since I tried multiple answers and it didn’t seem like anyone else had that problem. I knew the code worked (made it in codepen) so I just went ahead to the next step.
